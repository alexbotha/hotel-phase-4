# Welcome to bookingsPlus

---

A modern bookings app that allows users to keep track of their hotel stays as well as view the stays of other members.

### Project

---

As someone who is fantatic about travel, I decided to create a booking app for my phase-4 project. The thought process behind this was to create an easy to use, slick and modern application that allowed you to keep track of places you and friends have stayed. Thus, allowing you to revist your d stays, and add new stays upon discovering somewhere new. The beauty of this project is that it will be ever growing. Post graduation I will continue to add features, growing it bigger, and better.
